New six-sided die mechanism

Starting the game

- Both players start off by rolling a six-sided die
	- If you get the the highest number and the opponent gets the lowest number, you will go first
	- If the opponent gets the the highest number and the you get the lowest number, the opponent goes first

Capturing Pawns* (NEW!)

*An idea suggested for us by Tim

- If you attempt to capture the other player's pawn, it would require both players to roll a six-sided die
	- If you get the the highest number and the opponent gets the lowest number, you win the capture
	- If the opponent gets the the highest number and the you get the lowest number, you lose the capture and get sent back to your original position where you've moved before
